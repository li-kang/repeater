[00:07.000]--- First listen and then answer the question.^听录音，然后回答以下问题。

[00:12.720]--- What was the monster called?

[00:18.120]Fishermen and sailors sometimes claim to have seen monsters in the sea.^渔夫和水手们有时声称自己看到过海里的妖怪。

[00:24.760]Though people have often laughed at stories told by seamen,^虽然人们常常对水手们讲的故事付诸一笑，

[00:29.320]it is now known that many of these 'monsters' which have at times been sighted are simply strange fish.^但现在看来，人们有时看到的这些“妖怪”很多不过是些奇怪的鱼。

[00:40.080]Occasionally, unusual creatures are washed to the shore, but they are rarely caught out at sea.^一些异常的生物偶尔会被冲到岸上来，但它们在海上却极少能被捕到。

[00:48.720]Some time ago, however, a peculiar fish was caught near Madagascar.^然而不久前，在马达加斯加附近的海里却捕到了一条奇怪的鱼。

[00:55.640]A small fishing boat was carried miles out to sea by the powerful fish as it pulled on the line.^一条小渔船被一条咬住钩的强壮的大鱼拖到了几英里以外的海面上。

[01:04.240]Realizing that this was no ordinary fish, the fisherman made every effort not to damage it in any way.^那位渔民意识到这根本不是一条普通的鱼，于是千方百计不让它受到丝毫伤害。

[01:13.400]When it was eventually brought to shore, it was found to be over thirteen feet long.^当终于把它弄上岸后，人们发现它身长超过了13英尺。

[01:21.040]It had a head like a horse, big blue eyes, shining silver skin, and a bright red tail.^它长着一个像马一样的头，有着大的蓝眼睛和闪闪发光的银色皮肤，还有一条鲜红色的尾巴。

[01:31.320]The fish, which has since been sent to a museum where it is being examined by a scientist, is called an oarfish.^此鱼叫桨鱼，被送进了博物馆，现正接受一位科学家的检查。

[01:41.240]Such creatures have rarely been seen alive by man as they live at a depth of six hundred feet.^人们很少能看到活着的这类动物，因为它们生活在600英尺深的水下。
